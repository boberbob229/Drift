Drift

Drift is a quiet, invite-only study app designed for sustained focus and intentional learning.

It removes noise instead of adding features.
Nothing competes for your attention. Everything exists for a reason.

Overview

Most study tools try to motivate you with numbers, streaks, and pressure.
Drift does the opposite.

It creates a space that fades into the background so you can stay present with what you’re working on.

The interface is minimal, the structure is flexible, and the experience is deliberately slow.

Features

Invite-only accounts to keep the platform focused and intentional

Clean, distraction-free interface with generous spacing

Notion-inspired layout and visual hierarchy

Simple focus timer built for long sessions

Lightweight social elements without feeds or noise

Design Philosophy

Drift is opinionated.

Calm over stimulation

Clarity over customization

Focus over engagement

If something doesn’t directly support studying, it doesn’t belong here.

The interface is designed to stay visually quiet while still feeling deliberate and refined.
