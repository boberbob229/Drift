# Drift

A quiet, invite-only study app designed for sustained focus and intentional learning.

Drift removes noise instead of adding features. Nothing competes for your attention. Everything exists for a reason.

## Philosophy

Most study tools try to motivate you through gamification—points, streaks, leaderboards, notifications. Drift takes the opposite approach.

It creates a space that fades into the background so you can stay present with what you're working on. The interface is minimal, the structure is flexible, and the experience is deliberately slow.

**Drift is opinionated:**
- Calm over stimulation
- Clarity over customization  
- Focus over engagement

If something doesn't directly support studying, it doesn't belong here.

## Features
